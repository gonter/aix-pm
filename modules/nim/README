=head1 ABSTRACT

$Id: README,v 1.1 2007/06/03 16:56:23 gonter Exp $

This is a small collection of Perl modules and scripts that deal
with AIX NIM.

=head1 MODULES

There is no installation procedure yet, so just drop the Perl modules
into a directory where Perl will find them.  These should be placed
in one of Perl's library directories, e.g.
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/AIX/NIM/

  NIM/Config.pm     module AIX::NIM::Config
  NIM/Object.pm     module AIX::NIM::Object

NIM stores it's data in ODM files and can be queried using the AIX
lsnim command.  These modules interpret the output of the lsnim
command.  lsnim displays NIM configuration in a particular stanza
format.  Since this format is also useful for other applications
where configuration data needs to be recorded, I'm using these
modules also in other contexts, even when they have nothing to do
with AIX.

=head2 NIM/Config.pm

Main configuration module

=head2 NIM/Object.pm

Describes one NIM object, e.g. a single machine or backup

=head1 SCRIPTS

=head2 lsnim2html.pl

Transcribes NIM configuration into cross reference HTML form.

=head2 mknim.pl

Intended for automation of administrative tasks, mainly for
periodic mksysb backups.  This script needs an ODM database
called vx_task where it records mksysb backup session data
and a file named /etc/nimpolicy where an administrator
describes the backup policy which mknim.pl then tries to
implement.

=head1 TODO

There's a lot to do, especially the mknim.pl script may see
some changes.  ODM database creation and policy file need
some explanation.

=head1 BUGS, FEATURE REQUESTS, etc.

If possible, use the project's web site to report bugs
or place feature requests.  Also, updates may be posted
there too.
