These are a couple of AIX specific Perl modules that might be
useful for others.  This should be usable using AIX 4.2 and
later versions.

Furthermore, /modules/san/ contains various modules and script which
are intended for storage systems using EMC, IBM, and Brocade devices.

/modules/hp/ contains modules for HP machines running Linux.

There are also Modules on CPAN, which are not part of
this repository:

AIX::ODM
  see: http://search.cpan.org/~dfrench/AIX-ODM-1.0.2/ODM.pm

The following Perl packages are defined here:

AIX::odm
  simple ODM command interface

AIX::NIM::Config
AIX::NIM::Object
  ./nim/
  mostly NIM configuration parsing
  The stanza format that is generated by commands like "lsnim -l" is
  quite generic, so I'm using this format as a configuration file format
  for several purposes, even when the environment is not AIX.

AIX::Software::Maintenance
  ./sw-maint/
  Software Maintenance, e.g. things that involve lslpp and it's relatives
  
AIX::System::Stanza::Entry
AIX::System::Stanza::Comment
AIX::System::Stanza
  ./sys-stanza/

AIX::dev::atm::stats
AIX::dev::atm::attr
AIX::dev::atm
  ./dev-atm/
